A sumo robot that was ranked 1st among the class for the best designed and programmed robot.

This is the code for the sumo robot I created for my highschool tech course project.

This bot uses:
A CHRP3 pcb, custom designed by my tech teacher Mr. Rampelt, containing a few microcontrollers, LEDs, buttons, a piezo beeper, space for an LCD screen, and more. This is all powered by 4 AA batteries.
2 servo motors
A sonar sensor
